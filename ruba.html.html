            <p>
                Behold her, single in the field,
                Yon solitary Highland Lass!
                Reaping and singing by herself;
                Stop here, or gently pass!
            </p>
            <p>
                Alone she cuts and binds the grain,
                And sings a melancholy strain;
                O listen! for the Vale profound
                Is overflowing with the sound.
            </p>
            <p>
                No Nightingale did ever chaunt
                More welcome notes to weary bands
                Of travellers in some shady haunt,
                Among Arabian sands:
            </p>
            <p>
                A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
                In spring-time from the cuckoo-bird,
                Breaking the silence of the seas
                Among the farthest Hebrides.
            </p>
            <p>
                Will no one tell me what she sings?
                Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
                For old, unhappy, far-off things,
                And battles long ago;
            </p>
            <p>
                Or is it some more humble lay,
                Familiar matter of to-day?
                Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,
                That has been, and may be again?
            </p>
            <p>
                Whate’er the theme, the maiden sang
                As if her song could have no ending;
                I saw her singing at her work,
                And o’er the sickle bending;
            </p>
            <p>
                I listened, motionless and still;
                And, as I mounted up the hill,
                The music in my heart I bore,
                Long after it was heard no more.
